## Huge thanks to the Dungeon Quest Wiki.
All of the information you see in `calculators.py` or `data.py` has been extracted from the source code of the Dungeon Quest Wiki.
All of the custom values are extracted from the source code of the Dungeon Quest Wiki. This is why most of them don't make sense to the naked eye.

This would not be possible without the Dungeon Quest Wiki.
I want to thank the Dungeon Quest Wiki for providing such a great resource for the community.
I have simply extracted the JavaScript code, and turned it into Python code.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me on Discord.
